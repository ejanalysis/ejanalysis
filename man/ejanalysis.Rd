\title{Tools for Environmental Justice (EJ) Analysis}
\description{
This R package provides tools for environmental justice (EJ) analysis,
including metrics characterizing disparities between demographic groups,
such as differences in environmental or other indicators measured for each Census unit
such as Census blocks, block groups, tracts, zip codes, or counties.

These tools simplify some basic tasks in
exploring and analyzing a dataset in a matrix or data.frame
that contains data on demographics (e.g., counts of residents in poverty)
and local environmental indicators (e.g., an air quality index),
with one row per spatial location (e.g., Census block group).
Key functions help to find relative risk or similar ratios of means in demographic groups,
, etc.
