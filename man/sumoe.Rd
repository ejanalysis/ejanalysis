\title{Margin of Error for a Sum}
\usage{
sumoe(estimates, moes, include0 = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimates}{A matrix or data.frame of numbers that are the estimates to be added across columns.
Each row represents another place such as a Census block group, where the sum of all columns is calculated once for each place.}

\item{moes}{A matrix of data.frame like estimates parameter, but with MOE values for the corresponding counts provided in estimates.}

\item{include0}{Default is FALSE. If TRUE, based MOE on all data, even where estimate is zero, which gives MOEs that create conservatively wide confidence intervals.}
}
\value{
Returns margin(s) of error same shape as parameter estimates
}
\description{
Estimates the margin of error (MOE) that characterizes uncertainty, for a sum of estimates,
  based on their MOE values.
}
\details{
This is based on US Census Bureau recommendations for working with American Community Survey summary file data.
  This also works for differences (subtraction), not just sums.
  For example, one can estimate MOE for number of people with less than high school education in a block group, given
  estimates and margins of error for the count whose educational attainment is no school, first grade, second grade... 11th grade.
