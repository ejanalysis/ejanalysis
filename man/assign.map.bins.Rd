\title{Assign Each Row (Place) to a Bin Based on Cutpoints}
\usage{
assign.map.bins(pctiles.vector, cutpoints = c((0:9)/10, 0.95, 1),
  labels = 1:11)
}
\arguments{
\item{pctiles.vector}{Vector of percentiles as decimal fractions, 0 to 1, one per place.}

\item{cutpoints}{Optional vector of cutpoints defining edges of bins. Default is every 0.10 from 0 to 1.00, as well as 0.95}

\item{labels}{vector of bin numbers, optional (default is 1 through 11, and NA values are put in bin 0).}
}
\value{
Returns a vector bin numbers.
}
\description{
Takes a vector (not matrix or df) of values and returns a vector of bin numbers.
For creating color-coded maps (choropleths), assign each place (e.g., each row of a single column) to a bin.
Each bin represents one map color, and is defined by cutoff values.
}
\details{
The default bins 0-11 are defined as follows: \cr
bin 0: PCTILE=NA \cr
... \cr
bin 9:  0.80<=PCTILE<0.90 \cr
bin 10: 0.90<=PCTILE<0.95 \cr
bin 11: 0.95<=PCTILE<=1.00  \cr
}
\examples{
junk<-c(0,0.799,0.8, 0.8000001, 0.8999999,0.95,0.95001,1)
data.frame(pctile=junk, bin=assign.map.bins(junk))
# How it puts these in bins by default:
#      pctile bin   notes
#1  0.0000000   1
#2  0.7990000   8
#
#3  0.8000000   9 (0.80<=PCTILE<0.90 )
#4  0.8000001   9 (0.80<=PCTILE<0.90 )
#5  0.8999999   9 (0.80<=PCTILE<0.90 )
#
#6  0.9000000  10 (0.90<=PCTILE<0.95 )
#7  0.9001000  10 (0.90<=PCTILE<0.95 )
#8  0.9499990  10 (0.90<=PCTILE<0.95 )
#
#9  0.9500000  11 (0.95<=PCTILE<=1.00 ) I.E. THIS INCLUDES 100th percentile
#10 0.9500100  11 (0.95<=PCTILE<=1.00 ) I.E. THIS INCLUDES 100th percentile
#11 1.0000000  11 (0.95<=PCTILE<=1.00 ) I.E. THIS INCLUDES 100th percentile
