\title{Weighted Percentiles and Bin Numbers for Each Column, by zone, such as percentiles within each State}
\usage{
make.bin.pctile.cols(raw.data.frame, weights = 1, zone = NULL,
  as.df = TRUE, prefix.bin = "bin.", prefix.pctile = "pctile.",
  cutpoints = c((0:9)/10, 0.95, 1), labels = 1:11)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw.data.frame}{Data.frame of values}

\item{weights}{Optional Numeric vector of weights to create weighted percentiles, such as population-weighted quantiles. Unweighted if not specified. Vector same length as number of rows in data.frame.}

\item{zone}{NULL by default, but if a vector is provided, it defines zones to group by, so percentiles are within a given zone only.}

\item{as.df}{Optional logical TRUE by default, in which case matrix results are converted to data.frame}

\item{prefix.bin}{Optional character element, default is 'bin.', provides text to paste to beginning of input data.frame column names to use as bin output column names.}

\item{prefix.pctile}{Optional character element, default is 'pctile.', provides text to paste to beginning of input data.frame column names to use as pctile output column names.}

\item{cutpoints}{Default is 1:11. see \code{\link{make.bin.cols}}}

\item{labels}{Default is c(0.00, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90,  0.95,  1.00). see \code{\link{make.bin.cols}}}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix or data.frame
}
\description{
This function just combines \code{\link{make.pctile.cols}} and \code{\link{make.bin.cols}}.
Takes a data.frame of values and returns a data.frame (or matrix) of percentiles,
showing the percentile of a value within all values in its column, as well as bin numbers,
showing what bin each falls into, based on specified cutoffs defining bins. \cr\cr
** Work in progress/ not fully tested, e.g., need to test if all code below works with both as.df=TRUE and as.df=FALSE
