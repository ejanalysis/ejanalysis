\usage{
flagged.by(x, threshold, or.tied, below, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data.frame or matrix of numbers to be compared to threshold value.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. The threshold or threshold to which numbers are compared. Default is arithmetic mean of row. Usually one number, but can be a vector of same length as number of rows, in which case each row can use a different threshold.}

\item{or.tied}{Logical. Default is FALSE, which means we check if number in x is greater than the threshold (>). If TRUE, check if greater than or equal (>=).}

\item{below}{Logical. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, uses > or >= threshold. If FALSE, uses < or <= threshold.}

\item{...}{optional additional parameters to pass to \code{\link[analyze.stuff:cols.above.which]{analyze.stuff::cols.above.which()}}}
}
\value{
Returns a logical matrix the same size as x.
}
\description{
Flag which cells are at or above some threshold.
}
\details{
For a matrix with a few cols of related data, find which cells are at/above (or below) some threshold.
Returns a logical matrix, with TRUE for each cell that is at/above the threshold.
Can be used in EJ analysis as 1st step in identifying places (rows) where some indicator(s) is/are at/above a threshold, threshold value.
}
\note{
Future work: these functions could have wts, na.rm, & allow cutpoints or benchmarks as a vector (not just 1 number), & have benchnames.

\examples{
out <- flagged.by(x<-data.frame(a=1:10, b=rep(7,10), c=7:16), threshold=7)
x; out # default is or.tied=FALSE
out <- flagged.by(data.frame(a=1:10, b=rep(7,10), c=7:16), threshold=7, or.tied=TRUE, below=TRUE)
out
out <- flagged.by(data.frame(a=1:10, b=rep(7,10), c=7:16) )
# Compares each number in each row to the row's mean.
out
}
\seealso{
cols.above.which,  another name for the exact same function.

cols.above.count or cols.above.pct to see, for each row, count or fraction of columns with numbers at/above/below threshold.

flagged.only.by to find cells that are the only one in the row that is at/above/below the threshold.

rows.above.count, rows.above.pct, rows.above.which
