\title{RR for one environmental indicator, one demographic group}
\usage{
rrf(e, d, pop, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{Environmental indicator vector, one number per place, required.
e is environmental index or health risk level (e.g., PM2.5 concentration to which this person or place is exposed)}

\item{d}{Demographic indicator vector, required, one number per place, fraction of population that is in group of interest
d is percent of place that is selected demog group (e.g. percent Hispanic) (or d=1 or 0 if this is a vector of individuals)}

\item{pop}{Population total per place, required, of which d is a fraction.
pop is population count of place (or pop=1 if this is a vector of individuals)}

\item{na.rm}{Logical optional TRUE by default in which case NA values (missing values) are removed first. If FALSE, any NA value in pop, e, or d would make result NA.}
}
\value{
Returns one number
}
\description{
**Probably obsolete given \code{\link{RR}}. \cr\cr
  Inputs are vectors over small places like Census blocks or block groups
  or possibly individuals (ideally) but then d would be a dummy=1 for selected group and 0 for people not in selected group

 # rrf(places$pm, places[ , unlist(Dlist)[1]],  places$pop)
