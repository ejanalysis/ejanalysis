\title{Overlay Two PDFs as Weighted Histogram-Like Density Plots}
\usage{
pop.cdf.density(e, dcount, refcount, etxt, dtxt, brks = 10, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{Environmental or other indicator values vector}

\item{dcount}{Vector of weights for the demographic group of interest, such as population counts of Hispanics by Census tract.}

\item{refcount}{Vector of weights for the reference group, such as population counts of individuals who are not Hispanic, by Census tract.}

\item{etxt}{Character string to name e in graph}

\item{dtxt}{Character string to name d in graph}

\item{brks}{Default is 10. Passed as breaks param to plot function}

\item{...}{other parameters passed to \code{density}}
}
\value{
Creates a plot
}
\description{
Use plot(density()) to see overlay of two distribution functions.
}
\details{
Assumes you have weights for each and are comparing values in one group vs another.
