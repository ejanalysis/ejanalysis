\title{Kolm-Pollak Inequality Index adjustable for indexing inequality in bad outcomes}
\usage{
KolmPollak(x, parameter = 1, na.rm = TRUE, bigbadx = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Same as in \code{\link[ineq]{Kolm}}.}

\item{parameter}{Same as in \code{\link[ineq]{Kolm}}.}

\item{na.rm}{Same as in \code{\link[ineq]{Kolm}}.}

\item{bigbadx}{Optional, default is FALSE. Setting bigbadx = TRUE means bigger x values are bad, as in the case of x measuring levels of risk to health, or exposure to a pollutant.
If bigbadx=TRUE, the x values are first transformed into 0 - x}
}
\value{
This returns what Kolm does, except if bigbadx=TRUE it first transforms x.
}
\description{
This is a simple wrapper for the ineq::Kolm function, but
  it makes explicit the need to transform x first if x measures a harm or cost.
}
\details{
The Kolm-Pollak inequality index is provided by the package \pkg{ineq},
  but that index is only suitable for use with a variable where larger values are preferred, such as with income.
  The need for this type of transformation is noted by Maguire and Sheriff (2011) in \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph8051707}
  Many variables represent negative outcomes, such as measures of risks to health, or costs.
  For those types of variables, the variable should first be transformed by multiplying it by negative one.
  This function does that when a parameter is set appropriately. \cr \cr
  The typical KP index says inequality is \strong{worse if some incomes are very low}
  (than if some are very high). The adjusted KP index says
  inequality is \strong{worse if some costs or health risks are very high}
  (than if some are very low).

\examples{
 # Typical KP index says
 #   inequality is worse
 #   if some incomes are very low
 #   (than if some are very high):
 KolmPollak(c(-5,0,1), bigbadx = FALSE) #[1] 2.577229
 KolmPollak(c(-1,0,5), bigbadx = FALSE) #[1] 1.549793

 # Adjusted KP index says
 #   inequality is worse
 #   if some costs or health risks are very high
 #   (than if some are very low):
 KolmPollak(c(-1,0,5), bigbadx = TRUE) #[1] 2.577229
 KolmPollak(c(-5,0,1), bigbadx = TRUE) #[1] 1.549793

 set.seed(99)
 x=rep(c(1,2,5),50)*rnorm(mean=1, sd=0.2, n=50*3)
 ineq::Kolm(x)
 KolmPollak(x)
 KolmPollak(x, bigbadx = TRUE)
