\title{Extract county name from Census geo name field}
\usage{
get.name.county(placename)
}
\arguments{
\item{placename}{character vector, required, with text names of places from Census Bureau,
such as 'Block Group 1, Census Tract 1, Aleutians East Borough, Alaska'}
}
\value{
character vector of names
}
\description{
Parse text names of places from Census Bureau datasets like American Community Survey 5-year Summary File.
Extracts partial (e.g., just state or county name) text name of a place from the full Census text name of a place.
}
\details{
Inputs can be tracts or block groups as in the relevant ACS summary files, possibly others at some point.  \cr
 For tracts, there are only 3 parts to placename (tract, county, state)  \cr
For block groups, there are 4 parts to placename (block group, tract, county, state) \cr
Note that County names are not unique -- the same County name may exist in 2+ States. \cr

See \url{http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/files/national_county.txt} but file has moved
 Note old code was in GET COUNTY NAMES FROM NHGIS DATASET.R
