#' @title Calculate environmental justice (EJ) index for each place
#'
#' @description Create an index that combines environmental and demographic indicators for each Census unit (e.g., block group).
#' @details Creates one EJ index column for each environmental indicator column,
#'  or if given a vector or single column of environmental indicators instead of data.frame, returns a vector or column.
#'  Each "place" can be a Census unit such as a State, County, zip code, tract, block group, block, for example (or even by individual if person-level data are available).\cr
#' \cr
#'  Note: For 1.5, 3.5, 4.5 need vector d.avg.all.elsewhere. calculated in each of those.\cr
#'  * But does not properly handle cases where us.demog or universe.us.demog specified because denominator is not same as pop \cr
#'  * and need to fix for when  is.na(p) | is.na(demog) \cr
#'  Type 2 however does handle NA values appropriately, meaning a result for a given col of env.df is set to NA for a given row (assuming na.rm=FALSE) if and only if NA is found in that row, in demog or weights or that one col of env.df.
#'
#' @param env.df Environmental indicators vector or numeric data.frame, one column per environmental factor, one row per place (e.g., block group).
#' @param demog Demographic indicator(s) vector or data.frame, numeric fractions of population that is in specified demographic group (e.g., fraction below poverty line), one per place.
#' @param us.demog Optional number specifying overal area-wide value for demog (e.g., US percent Hispanic). Default is to calculate it as weighted mean of demog,
#'   where the weights are universe.us.demog if specified, or else just 'weights'.
#'   If the weights are population counts and demog is percent Hispanic, for example, us.demog is the percent  of US population that is Hispanic.
#' @param weights Optional, and default is equal weighting. If us.demog and universe.us.demog are not specified, weights are used to find
#'   weighted mean of demog to use as area-wide overall average (e.g., population-weighted average percent Hispanic, for all block groups in USA). One weight per place.
#' @param universe.us.demog Optional numeric vector. If specified and us.demog not specified, used instead of weights to get weighted mean of demog to find area-wide demog.
#'   This should be the actual denominator, or universe, that was used to create percent demog --
#'   universe.us.demog if specified should be a vector that has the count, for each place, of the denominator for finding the US overall percent  and this may be slightly different than total population.
#'   For example if demog=places$pctlowinc then true universe.us.demog=places$povknownratio which is the count for whom poverty ratio is known in each place, which is <= pop.
#' @param as.df Default is TRUE.
#' @param na.rm Default is FALSE. NOTE: This is complicated but important. See notes in source code about handling NA values in various formulas here.
#' @param prefix Optional character string used as first part of each colname in results. Default is "EJ.DISPARITY."
#' @param type Specifies type of EJ Index. Default is type=1. Several formulas are available: \cr
#' \itemize{
#'  \item For type=1,   ej.indexes = weights * env.df * (demog  - us.demog)  ## This is the EJ Index in EJSCREEN 2015. Note: us.demog could also be called d.avg.all, and note that na.rm is currently ignored for type=1
#'  \item For type=1.5, ej.indexes= weights * env.df * (demog  - d.avg.all.elsewhere) # for a place that is one of many this can be almost identical to type 1 \cr
#'  \item For type=2.1, ej.indexes = weights * demog  * (env.df - e.avg.all)  # like type 1 but env and demog roles are swapped \cr
#'  \item For type=2,   ej.indexes = weights * demog  * (env.df - e.avg.nond) \cr
#'  \item For type=2.5, ej.indexes = weights * demog  * (env.df - e.avg.nond.elsewhere )  \cr
#'  \item For type=3,   ej.indexes = weights * ( (demog * env.df) - (d.avg.all           * e.avg.nond ) )   \cr
#'  \item For type=3.5, ej.indexes = weights * ( (demog * env.df) - (d.avg.all.elsewhere * e.avg.nond.elsewhere) )   \cr
#'  \item For type 4  , ej.indexes = weights * ( (demog - d.avg.all          ) * (env.df - e.avg.nond ) ) \cr
#'  \item For type=4.5, ej.indexes = weights * ( (demog - d.avg.all.elsewhere) * (env.df - e.avg.nond.elsewhere) ) \cr
#'  \item For type=5  , ej.indexes = weights * env.df * demog ## A "Population Risk" or "Burden" index = Number of cases among D group if e is individual risk, or just "people-points among D" if e is "points" \cr
#'  \item For type=6,   ej.indexes = env.df * demog ## A "percent-based" indicator = percent in group D times envt indicator. \cr
#' }

#'  \item e.avg.nond.elsewhere =  avg environmental indicator value for average person who is not in the D-group, among all except in the one place being analyzed. \cr
