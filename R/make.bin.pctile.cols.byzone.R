#' @title May be obsolete-not used -was Percentile and bin number fields, by zone, such as percentiles within each State
#'
#' @description May be obsolete- just uses make.bin.pctile.cols() which now has a zone parameter.
#'   Get weighted percentiles and bin numbers, by subset of rows (zone), for each column of data.
#'   This can be used to calculate population-weighted percentiles within each State, for national data on Census block groups, for example.
#' @param bg Data.frame of data field(s), weights (optional), and a unique ID (e.g., FIPS), one row per place if geographic data is used.
#' @param zone Optional vector specifying subsets of rows (e.g. State name) within which percentiles are calculated
#' @param wtsvarname Name of field in bg that has optional weights for weighted percentiles. Default is unweighted.
#' @param keyvarname Name of field in bg that has unique ID per row (per place). Default is "FIPS"
#' @param datavarnames Vector of names of fields in bg that have numeric data for which percentiles are calculated.
#' @param clean Does not use clean.fips() if FALSE, which helps if the countiesall or other list is not yet updated, for example and lacks some new FIPS code
#' @param ... Other parameters passed to \code{\link{make.bin.pctile.cols}} such as \code{cutpoints} and \code{labels}
#' @return Returns a data.frame with one percentiles field and one bin numbers field for each of the datavarnames
